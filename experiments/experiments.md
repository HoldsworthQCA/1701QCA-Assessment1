#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I learnt how to probably wire a breadboard and resistor. Most of the electrical components of these experiments are new to me. I also had to adjust the photosensitivity in the code as it didn’t switch from the sun cycle to the moon cycle when I was shinnying a light onto it. This could also had been due to the low light when I was working. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as being used create a robot like this one https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17563688/robot-plant-hybrid-hexa-vincross-succulent. It is a robot driven succulent that seeks light when it needs an goes into shade when it needs it. This robot was devolped by Vincross.

### Dimming An LED Using A Potentiometer Experiment 3 ###

In this experiment, something new to me was wiring up the resistors and an LED. I found out it is important to have the LEDs facing the correct way in the circuit. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as light dimmers in homes and office buildings.

### Setting The Tone With A Piezo Buzzer Experiment 6 ###

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment I learnt how fiddly breadboards are and wire connectors are. I had to add a show led on button press as I could not tell what part of the experiment wasn’t working. It turned out to be the buzzer placement on the breadboard. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as most if not all portable music playing devices as well as electronic instruments this experiment however is much more rudimentary than any iPod or mp3 player but works on the same principle of push button play sound.
