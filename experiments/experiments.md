#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I learnt how to probably wire a breadboard and resistor. Most of the electrical components of these experiments are new to me. I also had to adjust the photosensitivity in the code as it didnâ€™t switch from the sun cycle to the moon cycle when I was shinnying a light onto it. This could also had been due to the low light when I was working. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as being used create a robot like this one https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17563688/robot-plant-hybrid-hexa-vincross-succulent. It is a robot driven succulent that seeks light when it needs an goes into shade when it needs it. This robot was devolped by Vincross.
