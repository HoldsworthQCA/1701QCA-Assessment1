## Replication project choice ##
(Insert the name of the project you chose to replicate.)

## Related projects ##
*Find about 6 related projects to the project you choose. A project might be related through  function, technology, materials, fabrication, concept, or code. Don't forget to place an image of the related project in the* `replicationproject` *folder and insert the filename in the appropriate places below. Copy the markdown block of code below for each project you are showing, updating the number* `1` *in the subtitle for each.*

This project is related to mine because in essence the kit involves creating a replica from Star Wars that makes a sound and lights up when the switch is activated. On the pure electric and basic principle level this is what I hope for my finale project to do.

This project relates to mine as the DIY approach and the concept of making what at the time was such a complex technology into something as small as an Altoids tin in fascinating. The DIY approach to design and manufacturing is compelling and how I plan to create my project. Do what you can with what you have and because for some reason you just have too.

Hacking my arm prosthesis to output CV so that it plugs into my synth: Thought-controlled music!

The idea of controlling a synthesiser with your brain blew my mind when I first saw the title. The aspects of this project that relates to mine is both the DIY aspect as well as the musical element. The musical element of being able to control a synthesiser with an arm prosthesis would be out of my reach currently but it could be an avenue of electronic music I could look further into. How the human body has been creating music since its birth and how into the modern era it is constantly evolving.

## Reading reflections ##
*Reflective reading is an important part of actually making your reading worthwhile. Don't just read the words to understand what they say: read to see how the ideas in the text fit with and potentially change your existing knowledge and maybe even conceptual frameworks. We assume you can basically figure out what the readings mean, but the more important process is to understand how that changes what you think, particularly in the context of your project.*

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

Before reading this I understood that certain things do certain things just because that’s what they do. For example a twist door knob means you push. However I did know that this innate understanding of objects was a part of a complex system of design called signifiers. 

Don Norman’s descriptions of how design has changed and shaped the world around us. This has changed my knowledge of how as a designer you interact with the process of design. How do you design for the human element, what signifiers do you embed into design to make sure a person knows how to use something. 

I would like to know more about how you can create more effective mapping within design and graphic design. How do you implement a natural feel to objects and graphics?  

The feedback and signifiers elements relate to the project as they are ideas in my project. The instant feedback from a tap is sound. This creates the interaction within my project. 

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

*What I thought before: Describe something that you thought or believed before you read the source that was challenged by the reading.*

*What I learned: Describe what you now know or believe as a result of the reading. Don't just describe the reading: write about what changed in YOUR knowledge.*

*What I would like to know more about: Describe or write a question about something that you would be interested in knowing more about.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: Describe the connection between the ideas in the reading and one of your current projects or how ideas in the reading could be used to improve your project.*

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

*What I thought before: Describe something that you thought or believed before you read the source that was challenged by the reading.*

*What I learned: Describe what you now know or believe as a result of the reading. Don't just describe the reading: write about what changed in YOUR knowledge.*

*What I would like to know more about: Describe or write a question about something that you would be interested in knowing more about.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: Describe the connection between the ideas in the reading and one of your current projects or how ideas in the reading could be used to improve your project.*


## Interaction flowchart ##
*Draw a flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Process documentation

*In this section, include text and images that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.*

*This should have quite a lot of information!*

*There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. Use the code below to include images, and copy it for each image, updating the information for each.*

![Image](missingimage.png)

*Include screenshots of the code you have used.*

## Project outcome ##

*Complete the following information.*

### Project title ###

### Project description ###

*In a few sentences, describe what the project is and does, who it is for, and a typical use case.*

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*

### Additional view ###

*Provide some other image that gives a viewer a different perspective on the project such as more about how it functions, the project in use, or something else.*

### Reflection ###

*Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.*


*What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?*


*What ideas have you read, heard, or seen that informed your thinking on this project? (Provide references.)*


*What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used?*
